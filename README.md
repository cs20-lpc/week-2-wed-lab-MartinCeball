# Week 2 Wed Lab

## Directions

You will be implementing the List ADT as an array-based class. The `List` abstract class is already given to you, along with the header file for the `ArrayList` class, and a skeleton of its implementation file. A driver program is also provided that tests the various operations for the class.

A few notes as your work through this:

- If you need to access the `length` attribute in your `ArrayList` class, you need to write it as `this->length`
- The `buffer` attribute is meant to be a fixed-size, dynamic array
- There are a number of operations that need to consider if it's invalid for it to be called: in those scenarios, make sure to `throw` a `string` exception explaining the error, like this
```C++
throw string("message goes here");
```
- The tests provided are not exhaustive, consider writing your own additional tests

## Sample Run

The following is a sample run of my solution. You can use this as a model to aim for with your program.

```
replace: error, position out of bounds
insert: error, position out of bounds
May Your Heart
Element 2: Heart
May Your Drums Beat
remove: error, position out of bounds
List is empty, no elements to display.
thirdList length: 3
thirdList maximum size: 5
getElement: error, position out of bounds
append: error, list is full
insert: error, list is full
May Your Heart Be A Yellow
myList is empty!
```
